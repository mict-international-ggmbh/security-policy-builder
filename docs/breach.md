`2021.11`

In the case of a breach, MiCT shall notify all affected
Partners. It is the responsibility of the Partners to notify affected
individuals.

## Policy Statements

MiCT policy requires that:

breach that results in unauthorized disclosure of unprotected/unencrypted
sensitive data.

(b) Individuals impacted by a confirmed data breach must be notified within 60
days of discovery of such breach.


## Controls and Procedures


### Breach Investigation Process

1. Discovery of Breach: A data breach shall be treated as "discovered" as of
   the first day on which such breach is known to the organization, or, by
   exercising reasonable diligence would have been known to MiCT
   (includes breaches by the organization's Partners, or
   subcontractors). MiCT shall be deemed to have knowledge of a
   breach if such breach is known or by exercising reasonable diligence would
   have been known, to any person, other than the person committing the breach,
   who is a workforce member or Partner of the organization. Following the
   discovery of a potential breach, the organization shall begin an
   investigation (see organizational policies for security incident response
   and/or risk management incident response) immediately, conduct a risk
   assessment, and based on the results of the risk assessment, begin the
   process to notify each Partner affected by the breach. MiCT
   shall also begin the process of determining what external notifications are
   required or should be made (e.g., media outlets, law enforcement officials, etc.)

1. Breach Investigation: The MiCT Security Officer shall name an
   individual to act as the investigator of the breach (e.g., privacy officer,
   security officer, risk manager, etc.). The investigator shall be responsible
   for the management of the breach investigation, completion of a risk
   assessment, and coordinating with others in the organization as appropriate
   (e.g., administration, security incident response team, human resources, risk
   management, public relations, legal counsel, etc.) The investigator shall be
   the key facilitator for all breach notification processes to the appropriate
   entities (e.g., HHS, media, law enforcement officials, etc.). All
   documentation related to the breach investigation, including the risk
   assessment, shall be retained for a minimum of seven years. A breach log is
   kept and maintained by the Security and Privacy Officer.

1. Risk Assessment: A risk assessment is performed in accordance to applicable
   laws and regulations.

1. Timeliness of Notification: Upon discovery of a breach, notice shall be made
   to the affected MiCT Partners, usually within 24-48 hours
   but no later than 10 calendar days after the discovery of the breach. It is
   the responsibility of the organization to demonstrate that all notifications
   were made as required, including evidence demonstrating the necessity of
   delay.

1. Delay of Notification Authorized for Law Enforcement Purposes:  If a law
   enforcement official states to the organization that a notification, notice,
   or posting would impede a criminal investigation or cause damage to national
   security, the organization shall:

    * If the statement is in writing and specifies the time for which a delay is
      required, delay such notification, notice, or posting of the timer period
      specified by the official; or
    * If the statement is made orally, document the statement, including the
      identify of the official making the statement, and delay the notification,
      notice, or posting temporarily and no longer than 30 days from the date of
      the oral statement, unless a written statement as described above is
      submitted during that time.

1. Content of the Notice: The notice shall be written in plain language and must
   contain the following information:

    * A brief description of what happened, including the date of the breach and
      the date of the discovery of the breach, if known;
    * A description of the types of unsecured protected health information that
      were involved in the breach (such as whether full name, Social Security
      number, date of birth, home address, account number, diagnosis, disability
      code or other types of information were involved), if known;
    * Any steps the Partner should take to protect Partner data from potential
      harm resulting from the breach.
    * A brief description of what MiCT is doing to investigate
      the breach, to mitigate harm to individuals and Partners, and to protect
      against further breaches.
    * Contact procedures for individuals to ask questions or learn additional
      information, which may include a toll-free telephone number, an e-mail
      address, a web site, or postal address.

1. Methods of Notification: MiCT Partners will be notified via
   email and phone within the timeframe for reporting breaches, as outlined
   above.

1. Maintenance of Breach Information/Log: As described above and in addition to
   the reports created for each incident, MiCT shall maintain a
   process to record or log all breaches of unsecured sensitive data regardless
   of the number of records and Partners affected. The following information
   should be collected/logged for each breach (see sample Breach Notification
   Log):

    * A description of what happened, including the date of the breach, the date
      of the discovery of the breach, and the number of records and Partners
      affected, if known.
    * A description of the types of unsecured protected health information that
      were involved in the breach (such as full name, Social Security number,
      date of birth, home address, account number, etc.), if known.
    * A description of the action taken with regard to notification of patients
      regarding the breach.
    * Resolution steps taken to mitigate the breach and prevent future
      occurrences.

1. Workforce Training: MiCT shall train all members of its
   workforce on the policies and procedures with respect to sensitive data as
   necessary and appropriate for the members to carry out their job
   responsibilities. Workforce members shall also be trained as to how to
   identify and report breaches within the organization.

1. Complaints: MiCT must provide a process for individuals to
   make complaints concerning the organization's patient privacy policies and
   procedures or its compliance with such policies and procedures.

1. Sanctions: The organization shall have in place and apply appropriate
   sanctions against members of its workforce and Partners who fail
   to comply with privacy policies and procedures.

1. Retaliation/Waiver: MiCT may not intimidate, threaten, coerce,
   discriminate against, or take other retaliatory action against any individual
   for the exercise by the individual of any privacy right. The organization may
   not require individuals to waive their privacy rights under as a condition of
   the provision of treatment, payment, enrollment in a health plan, or
   eligibility for benefits.
