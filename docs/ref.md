  created by MiCT, or maintained and created by a Partner.

* *Application Level*: Controls and security associated with an Application. In
  the case of PaaS Partners, MiCT does not have access to and cannot assure
  compliance with security standards and policies at the Application Level.

* *Audit*: Internal process of reviewing information system access and activity
  (e.g., log-ins, file accesses, and security incidents). An audit may be done
  as a periodic event, as a result of a patient complaint, or suspicion of
  employee wrongdoing.

* *Audit Controls*: Technical mechanisms that track and record computer/system
  activities.

* *Audit Logs*: Encrypted records of activity maintained by the system which
  provide: 1) date and time of activity; 2) origin of activity (app); 3)
  identification of user doing activity; and 4) data accessed as part of
  activity.

* *Access*: Means the ability or the means necessary to read, write, modify, or
  communicate data/ information or otherwise use any system resource.

* *BaaS*: Backend-as-a-Service. A set of APIs, and associated SDKs, for rapid
  mobile and web application development. APIs offer the ability to create
  users, do authentication, store data, and store files.

  computer system. This can either be complete, meaning all data and programs,
  or incremental, including just the data that changed from the previous backup.

* *Backup Service*: A logging service for unifying system and application logs,
  encrypting them, and providing a dashboard for them. Offered with all MiCT
  Add-ons and as an option for PaaS Partners.

* *Breach*: A data breach is the intentional or unintentional release of secure
  or sensitive information to an untrusted environment or individual. A data
  breach often involves an incident where information is stolen or taken from a
  system without the knowledge or authorization of the system's owner.
  
* *Business Associate*: A person or entity that performs certain functions or
  activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information
  on behalf of, or provides services to, a covered entity.

members are primarily considered as remote users and therefore must follow all
system access controls and procedures for remote access.

(b) Use of MiCT computing systems is subject to monitoring by
MiCT IT and/or Security team.

(c) Employees may not leave computing devices (including laptops and smart
devices) used for business purpose, including company-provided and BYOD devices,
unattended in public.

(d) Device encryption must be enabled for all mobile devices accessing company
data, such as whole-disk encryption for all laptops.

license. Do not use personal software for business purposes and vice versa.

(f) Encrypt all email messages containing sensitive or confidential data.

(g) Employees may not post any sensitive or confidential data in public forums
or chat rooms. If a posting is needed to obtain technical support, data must be
sanitized to remove any sensitive or confidential information prior to posting.

(h) Anti-malware or equivalent protection and monitoring must be installed and
enabled on all endpoint systems that are commonly affected by malware, including
workstations, laptops and servers.

(i) All data storage devices and media must be managed according to the MiCT
Data Classification specifications and Data Handling procedures.

(j) Mobile devices are not allowed to connect directly to MiCT production
environments.

### Your responsibilities for computing devices

MiCT provides company-issued laptops and workstations to all employees.
MiCT currently does not require or support employees bringing their own
computing devices.

The laptops and/or workstations assigned to you are yours to configure and
manage according to company security policy and standards. You are responsible
to

* configure the system to meeting the [configuration and management
  requirements](ccm.md), including password policy, screen protection timeout,
  host firewall, etc.;

* ensure the required anti-malware protection and security monitoring agent is
  installed and running; and

* install the latest security patches timely or enable auto-update.

IT and Security provides automated scripts for end-user system configurations
and/or technical assistance as needed.

You are also responsible for maintaining a backup copy of the business files
local on your laptop/workstation to the appropriate location on
MiCT file sharing / team site (e.g. SharePoint). Examples of
business files include, but are not limited to:

* Documents (e.g. product specs, business plans)
* Presentations
* Reports and spreadsheets
* Design files/images/diagrams
* Meeting notes/recordings
* Important records (e.g. approval notes)

!!! important

    DO NOT backup critical data such as partner data or PII to file sharing sites.
    If you have such critical data locally on your device, contact IT and
    Security for the appropriate data management and protection solution.

Unless the local workstation/device has access to **Critical** data, backups of
user workstations/devices are self managed by the device owner. Backups may be
stored on an external hard drive or using a cloud service such as iCloud if and
only if the data is both encrypted and password protected (passwords must meet
MiCT requirements).

### Getting help

Support for most of our business applications are self-service, such as password
reset via Okta.

If needed, users may use our internal service desk to request IT and Security
support.  Common requests include:

* Password reset and access requests
* Request new software and hardware
* Technical support
* Recommend changes to policies and processes

### How to report an incident or suspicious activity

You are responsible to report all suspicious activities and security-related
incidents immediately to the Information Security team, by one of the following
channels:

* (preferred) “Report a security incident” by creating an issue on
  Github and/or via the
  [internal help desk](](mailto:security@mict-international.org)

* For non-sensitive, non-confidential security issues and concerns, employees
  may post questions on MiCT’s #infosec Slack channel.

* Additionally, employees may report the incident to their direct manager.

* To report a concern under the Whistleblower Policy, you may first discuss the
  concerns with your immediate manager, or report it directly to the CEO or COO.
  *See the [Whistleblower Policy section in the HR Security Policy][5] for
  additional details.*

## INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU

When you use our Services, we collect the
following types of information.

### INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US ("PERSONAL INFORMATION")

**ACCOUNT INFORMATION.** Some information is required to create an account on
Services, such as your

* name,
* email address,
* password,
* company, and
* phone number.

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.** To help improve your experience or enable certain
features of the Services, you may choose to provide us with additional
information, such as

* a profile photo,
* biography,
* mailing address,
* country information,
* date of birth,
* gender,
* height,
* weight,
* additional health information or activity data such as your logs for food, weight, sleep, water,
* additional contact phone numbers such as your mobile telephone number,

* messages on discussion boards or to your social contacts on the Services.

You may also connect with friends on the Services or invite friends who have not
yet joined by providing their email addresses, accessing social networking
accounts or using the contact list on your mobile device. We do not store your
contact list and delete it after it is used for adding contacts as friends.

If you contact us or participate in a survey, contest, or promotion, we collect
the information you submit such as your name, email address, contact
information, and message.

**INFORMATION FROM THIRD-PARTY SERVICES.** If you choose to connect your
account on our Services to your account on another service, we may receive
information from the other service. For example, if you connect to Facebook or
Google, we may receive information like your name, profile picture, age range,
language, email address and friend list. You may also choose to grant us access
to your personal information such as activity data or health data from other
services. You can stop sharing the information from the other services with us
by removing our access to each other service.

**INFORMATION PROVIDED BY OTHER INDIVIDUALS.** While using our Services,
individuals may provide information about another individual, or an authorized
user (such as an account administrator) creating an account on your behalf may
provide information about You. When one individual provides us with information
(including personal information) about another individual, we assume that the
individual has permission and authority to do so and to consent on behalf of
that individual to the collection and use of personal information as described
in this Privacy Policy. Please contact us immediately if you become aware of an
individual providing us with personal information about another individual
without being authorized to do so, and we will act consistently with this
Privacy Policy.

**PAYMENT AND CARD INFORMATION.** Some MiCT Services
support payments and transactions with third parties. If you activate this
feature, you must provide certain information for identification and
verification, such as your name, billing address, credit, debit or other card
number, card expiration date and CVV code. This information is used solely to
check your financial qualifications and collect payment from you. We do not
store your payment information. We use a third-party service provider to manage
payment card processing. Note that third-party payment processors may retain
this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms. This
service provider is not permitted to store, retain or use information you
provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.

### INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES

**USAGE AND DEVICE INFORMATION.** When you use our Services, we receive certain
usage data ("Usage and Device Information"). This includes information about
your interaction with the Services, for example, when you view or search
content, install or open applications or software, create or log into your
account, import data into your account, or integrate a third-party service to
your account. We may also collect data about the devices and computers you use
to access our Services, including IP addresses, browser type, language,
operating system, or mobile device information (including device and application
identifiers), the referring web page, pages visited, location (depending on the
permissions you have granted us), and cookie information.

**HEALTH AND OTHER SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA.** To the extent that
information we collect directly from you is health data or another special
category of sensitive personal data subject to the European Union’s General Data
Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), we ask for your explicit consent to process such
sensitive personal data. We obtain this consent separately when you take actions
leading to our obtaining the data, for example, when you activate the activity
tracking features in our Mobile Apps or grant us access to your health or
activity data from another service. You can use your account settings or contact
us to withdraw your consent at any time, including by stopping use of a feature,
removing our access to a third-party service, requesting deletion your data or
closing your account.  

However, if we are acting as a service provider (a "Data Processor") processing
your personal information on behalf of a third party that has collected such
data from you, and such third party is the party that has the right to determine
the purposes for which it will process your personal information and the means
it will use to process your personal information (the "Data Controller"), then
such Data Controller has the legal obligation to ask for your explicit consent
to process your sensitive personal data (including health data), and we are not
responsible for obtaining such consent from you.  In such a scenario, the Data
Controller may have their own, separate policies regarding the use and
disclosure of your personal information, including any sensitive personal data
you provide to such Data Controller.  In such a scenario, this Privacy Policy
does not apply to, we cannot control the activities of, and we are not
responsible for the activities of the applicable Data Controller generally; this
Privacy Policy only applies to our processing of your personal information that
we, as a Data Processor, have been asked to process on behalf of the Data
applicable Data Controller.  We encourage you to review such Data Controller’s
privacy policy and/or contact the applicable Data Controller for more
information about the policies that apply to their use and disclosure of your
personal information, including any sensitive personal data.

## HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

We use the information we collect for the following purposes.

### PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN THE SERVICES

We use the information we collect to deliver the Services to you and honor our
Terms of Service for each Service or business contract with you. For example,

* to administer, operate, maintain and secure our Services;
* to monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with our
  Services;
* for accounting, recordkeeping, backup and administrative purposes;
* to customize and improve the content of our communications, websites and
  social media accounts;
* to provide partner service and support;
* to communicate with you, including responding to your comments, questions and
  requests regarding our Services;
* to process and complete transactions, and send you related information,
  including alerts and notifications about your service, purchase confirmations
  and invoices; and
* to educate and train our workforce in data protection and
  partner support.

For the Services’ social features, we may use your information to help you find
and connect with other users and to allow other users to find and connect with
you. For example, your account contact information allows other users to add you
as a friend. When another user has your email or mobile phone number in their
contact list or in their friend network on a connected service, we may show that
user that you are a user of the Services.

### IMPROVE, PERSONALIZE, AND DEVELOP THE SERVICES

We use the information we collect to improve and personalize the Services and to
develop new ones. For example, we use the information to troubleshoot and
protect against errors; perform data analysis and testing; conduct research and
surveys and develop new features and Services.

### COMMUNICATE WITH YOU

We use your information when needed to send you Service notifications and
respond to you when you contact us. We also use your information to promote new
features or products that we think you would be interested in. You can control
marketing communications and most Service notifications by using your
notification preferences in account settings or via the "Unsubscribe" link in an
email.

### PROMOTE SAFETY AND SECURITY

We use the information we collect to promote the safety and security of the
Services, our users and other parties. For example, we may use the information

* to authenticate users;
* to facilitate secure payments;
* to respond to a legal request or claim, conduct audits, and enforce our terms
  and policies;
* to investigate and protect against fraud, malicious or unauthorized access,
  and other illegal activities; and
* to demonstrate and verify compliance with our internal policies and
  procedures, and applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations,
  such as GDPR.

### USE AND DISCLOSURE OF DE-IDENTIFIED INFORMATION

"De-identified" means that we have removed, or rendered unreadable through
complex computational algorithms, your personally-identifiable information, such
as your name, address, or birthdate. We may use de-identified information that
we have obtained from our Services for various purposes, including for example:

* In accordance with regulatory requirements, we may de-identify, store and use
  your information for internal quality control, validation and research and
  development. This is important for MiCT to maintain high
  quality Services. We may use de-identified information as permitted by law.
* We may contribute de-identified genetic variants that we have observed in the
  course of providing our Services to publicly available databases such as
  ClinVar. We do this to increase understanding and raise awareness of the
  significance of genetic variants within the medical and scientific
  communities.
* We may use or disclose de-identified information for general research and
  communications purposes. This may include analysis of this information to
  communicate observations and learnings, for example in the case of aggregated
  data. This may also include research collaborations with third parties, such
  as universities, hospitals or other laboratories, in which we utilize
  de-identified clinical cases, at the individual level or in the aggregate, in
  accordance with our study protocols, and we may present or publish such
  information. This may also include commercial collaborations with private
  companies for purposes such as to determine the prevalence of particular
  disorders or variants among the patients we have tested, or to determine
  whether any of the patients we have tested might be suitable for potential
  recruitment for research, clinical trials, or clinical care; however, we will
  not directly contact these patients about these opportunities without their
  prior written consent.

We use cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described above. For
more information, please read our [Cookie Policy]().

For personal data subject to the GDPR, we rely on several legal bases to process
the data. These include when you have given your consent, which you may withdraw
at any time using your account settings and/or other tools; when the processing
is necessary to perform a contract with you, like the Terms of Service; and our
legitimate business interests, such as in improving, personalizing, and
developing the Services, marketing new features or products that may be of
interest, and promoting safety and security as described above.

## HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

We do not share your personal information except in the limited circumstances
described below.

### WHEN YOU AGREE OR DIRECT US TO SHARE

You may direct us to disclose your information to others, such as when you use
our social features in our Mobile Apps. For certain information, you may change
your privacy preferences in account settings and use other provided tools to
control how your information is visible to other users of the Services.

You may also authorize us to share your information with others, for example,
with a third-party application when you give it access to your account, or with
your employer company or other organizations and provide consent to each
organization. Remember that their use of your information will be governed by
their privacy policies and terms. You can revoke your consent to share with
third-party applications or employee wellness programs using your account
settings.

### FOR EXTERNAL PROCESSING

We transfer information to our corporate affiliates, service providers and other
partners who process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with
this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
These partners provide us with services globally, including for partner
support, information technology, payments, sales, marketing, data analysis,
research and surveys.

### FOR LEGAL REASONS OR TO PREVENT HARM

We may preserve or disclose information about you to comply with a law,
regulation, legal process or governmental request; to assert legal rights or
defend against legal claims; or to prevent, detect or investigate illegal
activity, fraud, abuse, violations of our terms or threats to the security of
the Services or the physical safety of any person. Please note: Our policy is to
notify you of legal process seeking access to your information, such as search
warrants, court orders or subpoenas, unless we are prohibited by law from doing
so. In cases where a court order specifies a non-disclosure period, we provide
delayed notice after the expiration of the non-disclosure period. Exceptions to
our notice policy include exigent or counterproductive circumstances, for
example, when there is an emergency involving a danger of death or serious
physical injury to a person. We may share non-personal information that is
aggregated or de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an
individual. We may disclose such information publicly and to third parties, for
example, in public reports about exercise and activity, to partners under
agreement with us or as part of the community benchmarking information we
provide to users of our subscription services. If we are involved in a merger,
acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to take measures to protect the
confidentiality of personal information and give affected users notice for the
transferring of any personal information to a new entity.

## YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

You can access and control your personal information via account settings and/or
our tools we provide to you, regardless of where you live. If you live in the
European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland (the “Designated
Countries”), you have a number of legal rights with respect to your information,
as outlined below.

**Accessing and Exporting Data.** By logging into your account, you can access
much of your personal information. Using your account settings or by contacting
us, you can also request a download information in a commonly used file format,
including data about your activities, body, foods and sleep.

**Editing and Deleting Data.** Your account settings and certain platform APIs
let you change and delete your personal information and/or account data. For
instance, you can edit or delete the profile data you provide and delete your
account if you wish.

If you choose to delete your account, please note that while most of your
information will be deleted within 14 days, it may take up to 90 days to delete
all of your information, such as the data stored in our backup systems. This is
due to the size and complexity of the systems we use to store data. We may also
preserve data for legal reasons or to prevent harm, including as described in
the How We Share Your Information section.

**Objecting to Data Use.** You can control usage of your data via account
settings or other application APIs or tools. For example, you can

* limit how your information is visible to other users of the Services;
* limit the notifications you receive from us; and
* revoke the access of third-party applications that you previously connected to
  your account.

If you live in a Designated Country, in certain circumstances, you can object to
our processing of your information based on our legitimate interests, including
as described in the How We Use Information section. You have a general right to
object to the use of your information for direct marketing purposes. Please also
review our Cookie Policy for your options to control how we and our partners use
cookies and similar technologies for advertising.

**Restricting or Limiting Data Use.** In addition to the various controls that
we offer, if you reside in a Designated Country, you can seek to restrict our
processing of your data in certain circumstances. Please note that you can
always delete your account at any time.

Onward Transfers of Data.  If we intend to disclose your personal information to
any third party that will have the right to process it, we will enter into a
contract with that third party that provides that your personal information may
be processed only for limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent
you have provided to us, and that the third party must provide the same level of
protection for your personal information that we are obligated to provide under
this Privacy Policy while it is processing your personal information.  In
addition, we will notify you if that third party will have the right to
determine the purposes for which it will process your personal information and
the means it will use to process your personal information (rather than just
providing requested assistance to us in support of our permitted uses of your
personal information).

**Changes to Privacy Policy.**  If we are using your personal information on the
basis of your consent, and we change our Privacy Policy to permit any use or
disclosure of your personal information that is materially different than the
uses for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you, we
will obtain your consent before we make such further uses of your personal
information.

**Further Assistance.**  If you need further assistance regarding your rights,
please contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy@mict-international.org,
and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws. If you
reside in a Designated Country and you are not satisfied with our response, you
will have a prompt, no-cost way of asserting your claim by contacting our chosen
independent dispute resolution body JAMS.  If you reside in a Designated
Country, you may have the right, under certain conditions, to invoke binding
arbitration, and, alternatively, you also have a right to lodge a complaint with
your local data protection authority or with the Irish Data Protection
Commissioner, our lead supervisory authority, whose contact information is
available here.


## GDPR Data Processing Agreement/Addendum ("DPA")

## Data Protection Addendum

This Data Protection Addendum (this "Addendum") is made and entered into as of
the date appearing on the signature page hereto (the "Effective Date") by and
between MICT - Media in Cooperation &amp; Transition gGmbH ("Company") and the Supplier named on the signature page
hereto, and upon execution shall be incorporated by reference into each
agreement for services ("Services Agreement") pursuant to which Supplier may
Process (as defined below) Personal Data (as defined below) for, from, or on
behalf of Company.

### A. Personal Data Protection

For the purposes of this Addendum, the terms "Controller", "Data Subjects",
"Personal Data", "Personal Data Breach", "Processor" and "Process" shall have
the meaning as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 ("GDPR") or any
successor European Union data protection framework.

The parties agree that to the extent Supplier, in the context of performing the
agreed services, processes any Personal Data of Company, Supplier shall be the
Processor and Company shall be the Controller of such Personal Data.
Notwithstanding any obligations of Company as Controller under applicable data
protection law, Supplier undertakes the following as Processor:

(a) to process any Personal Data only on behalf and in accordance with Company’s
documented instructions and not for any purposes other than those described in
this Addendum, unless (i) Company has given its express prior consent or (ii)
Supplier is strictly required to do so under applicable European Data Protection
Law (as defined below); in such a case, Supplier shall inform Company of that
legal requirement before Processing, unless that law prohibits such information
on important grounds of public interest. The subject-matter and duration of the
Processing, the nature and purpose of the Processing, the type of Personal Data
and the categories of Data Subjects are further specified in Exhibit 1 to this
Addendum.

(b) to comply with (i) the GDPR and any applicable European data protection laws
and regulations (collectively “European Data Protection Law”), and (ii), in case
Supplier is certified under the EU-U.S. and/or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
Framework, or any successor program recognized under European Data Protection
Law to provide for an adequate level of data protection, the principles of such
applicable Privacy Shield Framework or successor program, and (iii) all other
applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations ((i) to (iii)
collectively “Data Protection Laws”).

(c) to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a
manner that the Processing, including by any Sub-Processors (as defined below),
will meet the requirements under Data Protection Laws and ensure the protection
of the rights of the Data Subjects, and to regularly test, assess and evaluate
the effectiveness of and, as necessary, improve and update these measures. The
measures shall ensure a level of data security appropriate to the risks for the
rights and freedoms of the Data Subjects. In particular, Supplier shall protect
the personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or
alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted,
stored or otherwise Processed.

(d) to keep Personal Data strictly confidential and to ensure, and be able to
demonstrate on request, that (i) only those persons have access to the Personal
Data who are authorized by Supplier and have a strict need to know the data for
the purposes under this Addendum, and (ii) all persons with access to Personal
Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate
statutory obligation of confidentiality.

(e) to disclose Personal Data to third parties, including affiliated companies,
and/or to engage another Processor for the Processing of Personal Data
(“Sub-Processor”) only with Company’s express prior consent. Where Supplier is
authorized to engage another Sub-Processor for carrying out Processing
activities on behalf of Company, Supplier shall enter into a written contract
with the Sub-Processor which (i) imposes on the Sub-Processor the same data
protection obligations as set forth in this Agreement, in particular providing
sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational
measures in such a manner that the Processing will meet the requirements under
Data Protection Laws, and (ii) grants Company the right to directly audit the
Sub-Processor as set forth under Section A(j). Supplier shall promptly send a
copy of any sub-processor agreement it concludes under this Section A(e) to
Company. Supplier shall select the Sub-Processor diligently, taking into account
the technical and organizational measures it has implemented, and ensure, by
carrying out audits before and regularly after the commencement of the data
processing by such Sub-Processor, that it maintains appropriate technical and
organizational measures to safeguard an adequate level of data protection within
the meaning of European Data Protection Law. Supplier shall remain fully liable
to Company for the performance of this Agreement and be responsible and liable
for any act or omission of the Sub-Processor with respect to its data protection
obligations.

(f) to assist Company, including by appropriate technical and organizational
measures, insofar as this is possible and taking into the nature of the
processing, in fulfilling its obligations in relation to requests from Data
Subjects for exercising their Data Subject’s rights under Data Protection Laws,
including, but not limited to, the Data Subject’s right of access, right to
rectification and erasure, right to restriction of processing, right to data
portability and right to object, as provided for under the GDPR.

(g) to assist Company, taking into account the nature of the processing and
information available to Supplier, in ensuring compliance with the obligations
under applicable Data Protection Laws, including, in particular, by providing
all information and assistance to enable Company (i) to comply with applicable
data security obligations, (ii) to carry out a data protection impact assessment
or prior consultation with the supervisory authority, as required under European
Data Protection Law, and (iii) to respond promptly and properly to any enquiries
concerning the Processing of Personal Data and cooperate in good faith with the
supervisory authorities, the Data Subjects or any third party within a
reasonable time. Supplier shall not communicate with any supervisory authority,
Data Subject or any third party in connection with the Processing of Company's
Personal Data without prior approval from Company, except as expressly permitted
in this Section A.

(h) to notify Company, without undue delay, in writing or via e-mail (i) of any
intended change of the locations currently set out in Exhibit 1 to this Addendum
for the Processing of Personal Data, (ii) in case of a dispute, claim or request
brought by a Data Subject directly against Supplier, (iii) in the event of any
measure, request or other communication by a supervisory authority, including
about any legally binding request for access or disclosure of Personal Data by a
public authority (unless otherwise legally prohibited, in which case the
Supplier will use its best efforts to obtain the right to waive this
prohibition), and provide reasonable assistance if Company wishes to contest the
request, and (iv) of any suspected or actual Personal Data Breach, any breach of
applicable Data Protection Laws or of this Addendum. Supplier shall promptly
remedy any breach and cooperate with Company in the investigation and remedy of
such breaches and provide all reasonable assistance and information to enable
Company to comply with, or, as applicable, to avoid, any data breach
notification obligations vis-à-vis supervisory authorities and/or Data Subjects.
Supplier shall further immediately inform Company if, in its opinion, an
instruction infringes Data Protection Laws and/or Supplier becomes aware of the
existence of any local laws that would have a substantial adverse effect on the
guarantees and undertakings provided for under this Addendum.

(i) at the choice of Company, to return to Company (in a standard format
facilitating portability) and/or to securely delete/destroy all Personal Data,
